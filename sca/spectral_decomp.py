    '''This function computes the spectral (eigenvalue) decomposition of the
        correlation matrices in SCA. It carries out the N samples trial of such
        decomposition for randomized alignments.
        Input : SCA correlation matrices
        Output: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of actual & randomized alignments.
        QUESTION : Do we want to return randomized eignevectors?
