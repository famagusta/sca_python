msa_search:

inputs:
- residue_list in python version takes care of both pdb and chainID_trunc in Octave version

1. AA list has 'END', 'GAP' to represent end of sequence and gaps in the sequences. Should they remain as they are now?
Refer to: read_pdb function, Bio.PDB.PDBParser class methods i.e., How does residue_list represent gaps in its resnames
2. smith_water_align returns the correct index of the sequence but wrong score.


smith_water_align:
'|' - match, ' ' - gap start, '.' - mismatch or gap-extension



STATUS:
MSAsearch.m till line 119 is checked.
